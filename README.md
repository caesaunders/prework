For my own iOS app idea, I would like to create an app that allows the user to track autoimmune condition flare ups. This app would allow the user to select factors and record dates. It would also offer predicted next dates for the flare ups. In an ideal world, this app would integrate with the Health app available to Apple users.

## Notes

I was unfamiliar with the IDE and the Swift language. I knew the syntax structure and how functions work within an app, but the challenge of navigating the IDE was my only setback.
